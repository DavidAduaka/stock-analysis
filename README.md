# VBA of Wall Street: Challenge 2

#Overview of Project
Steve wanted to prepare a macro-enabled workbook that analyzes the performance of green energy stocks for 2 years worth of data. The VBA code originally written provides this information with a click of a button. The original code provided a formatted table of volume and returns for 12 stocks based on the year the user entered.

#Purpose
Steve worries the orignal workbook and code may not be able to handle calculations for thousands of stocks in a timely manner. So, the purpose of this project is to refactor the code to make it run faster.
